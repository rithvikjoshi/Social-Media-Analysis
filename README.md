# Social-Media-Analysis

This proposal is a web application which is used to analyse the tweets. I will be
performing sentiment analysis in tweets and determine where it is positive, negative or
neutral. This web application can be used by any organization office to review their
works or by political leaders or by any others company to review about their products
or brands. The main feature of my web application is that it helps to determine the
opinion about the peoples on products, government work, politics or any other by
analysing the tweets. My system is capable of training the new tweets taking reference
to previously trained tweets.
The computed or analysed data will be represented in various diagram such as Piechart, Bar graph and Word cloud.

ALGORITHM

∑𝑖=𝑛(𝑝𝑜𝑠 𝑇𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑠)-∑𝑖=𝑛(𝑛𝑒𝑔 𝑇𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑠)= Tweet Score
Where n= Number of Tweets Searched by the user
Pos Tweets= Positive Tweets
Neg Tweets= Negative Tweets
